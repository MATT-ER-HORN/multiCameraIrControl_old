# multiCameraIrControl

Most recent version of Sebastian Setz's multiCameraIrControl arduino library that I could find. The other versions on github seem to be from older revisions that do not function correctly. shutterNow function tested on Sony and Pentax cameras  This version was retrieved from https://hackaday.io/project/11951/files.
